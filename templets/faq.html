            <div class="faq">
              <h2>When should I start preparing for JEE?</h2>
              <p>If your financial situation is really strong, it is advised to begin 
                your JEE preparation as early as possible in 9th or 10th grade. You can 
                also begin in the eleventh grade, as most students did in our survey. You 
                must consistently prepare and put in a lot of effort.If you decide to start 
                studying after your 12th grade year, it is not a good idea because you will be
                 under a lot of pressure to finish the entire syllabus in a shorter amount of time
                  than other students, who often take two or more years to finish it. If you begin
                   before the ninth grade, you risk becoming worn out by the end and being unable to
                    concentrate during the exam.

However, it is generally advised that students in class 11 devote at least 2-4 hours each day to focused and productive self-study, while students in class 12 devote 5-6 hours. You can alter the duration according to your capabilities, but consistency and quality of study are more important than the number of hours.</p>

    Effective study habits, quality materials, proper guidance, and a conducive learning atmosphere are key factors for 
   scoring well. These factors can be established at home or in a hostel, providing flexibility based on individual circumstances. 
   Ultimately, the student's dedication, focus, and support during preparation matter most, regardless of the chosen location.

    subjects but it is better to devote more time to the subject which you find difficult in order to clear concepts and problems related to
    the subject. Study the subject which you find difficult during the time of the day in which you find easy to concentrate like the early 
    morning hours or late night hours depending on your suitability .Study the subject which you find easy during less productive time if

<div class="faq">
  <h2>Is it necessary to take coaching test series along with self-study?
  </h2>

    with an opportunity to practice in an exam-like environment and assess 
    your performance. It helps in identifying your strengths and weaknesses, 
    improving time management, and getting acquainted with the examination 
    pattern. However, if you are unable to join coaching test series, you can still

<div class="faq">
  <h2>Which coaching should you join?
  </h2>
  <p>Based on the available data, joining Allen is recommended due
     to the proven benefits observed among a significant number of students.
      However, it is crucial to prioritize convenience and affordability when
       selecting a coaching institute. Opting for a centre close to your residence
        not only saves commuting time but also reduces expenses. While Allen is a favourable choice, 
        it is worth noting that Fiitjee has shown the highest probability of achieving good marks. Hence,
         it is advisable to consider both factors and evaluate which institute best meets your location,
          financial, and academic requirements for a successful and satisfactory learning experience.
