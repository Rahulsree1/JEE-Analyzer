                    <h2>Observation-</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Most of the students spent time 2-3 hours per day on digital media
                         which includes mobile phone, T .V, or other entertainment sources.<br> This is also important as it
                         refreshes the mind. But the student should not become addicted to it. In 12th this time gradually decreases.

                    <h2>Observation-</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Physical Activities are also very important aspect  in student’s life as it reduces student’s
                         stress, improves his concentration and enhances memory retention.<br> It also improves the focus. So many students spend
                          some time (less than 2 hours) in some kind of physical activities like sports, yoga , exercises etc. But In class<br>
                           12th this time decreases as they have more pressure of study in 12th .
