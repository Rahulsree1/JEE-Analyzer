                        <li>Starting in 12th is not a good option as we can see those
                            who started in 12th does not get very good marks as
                            compare to other. Only 1-2 students get above 120
                            marks.</li>
                        <li>Also those who were dropper not get very good marks.
                            They have to cover whole syllabus in one year. They
                            have very high pressure. This might be a reason that
                            they got less marks.</li>

                    <p>Following is the histogram showing JEE Advanced marks on x axis and number of students(frequency) on y axis

                        From the plot we understand that there very high variation in 
                        distribution of marks. If someone prepare seriously from 11th , he/she may get good marks.
